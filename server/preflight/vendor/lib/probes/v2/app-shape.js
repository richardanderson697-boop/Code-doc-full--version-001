// What KIND of app is this, and which findings does that change?
//
// Some findings are only findings because of who can reach them. A stack trace
// returned to the browser is a disclosure when the browser might belong to an
// attacker. In a tool that binds to 127.0.0.1 and serves exactly one person,
// that same stack trace is a debugging feature, and reporting 23 of them as
// security exposure is the scanner failing to understand what it is looking at.
//
// The response is awareness, not silence. A single-user loopback tool still
// gets the finding, at reduced weight, with the reason stated: it would matter
// if this were deployed. Hiding it would teach nothing and would be wrong the
// day the thing gets a public URL.
//
// Deliberately conservative. Every signal here has to be something a public
// multi-user app would not do.

// Server binds that cannot receive traffic from another machine.
// The port is usually a constant, not a literal: `server.listen(PORT,
// '127.0.0.1')`. Requiring \d+ meant the most common form in real code never
// matched, which is why a cockpit that binds loopback twice was not detected
// as local at all.
