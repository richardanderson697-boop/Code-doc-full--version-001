//
// F7: AI Codegen Bloat (v2 spec, docs/preflight-v2-spec.md). The family the
// spec calls the novel surface: no existing linter row in the tool-coverage
// matrix covers it. These are not vulnerabilities. They are the tells of code
// that was generated and shipped without a read-through, and the spec's whole
// argument is that those tells co-locate with the real defects.
//
// Severity ceiling for the family is MEDIUM by design. Nothing here is an
// exploit; the expected response is "go read this file", not "patch now".
//
// Within that ceiling the line is between artifacts and opinions. A backup file
// sitting in the tree is a thing that is there, so it earns the medium. Every
// other check in this family is a judgement about how code is written, and
// those are low. Function length used to break that rule at medium, which put
// it two and a half times above the cyclomatic-complexity check even though
// complexity measures the same property better (2026-07).
//
// Two roster entries from the spec are deliberately NOT implemented:
//   - "generic name pollution (data/result/temp/item)" — spec §1.8 separately
//     declines exactly this as unfixable-FP ("no deterministic signal separates
//     AI laziness from a callback parameter in a documented API"). The §1.8
//     reasoning wins over the roster line.
//   - "file over 500 lines" / "console statements in non-test" — already owned
//     by the Code Quality probe's file-size ladder and console check. Emitting
//     them here would double-report the same line.
